A PHP minifier and cacher for JS and CSS based on JsMin+ and CssMin by Fabricio Sodnao

I have no idea about licenses, so do whatever you want with it (even say you did it, if it makes you happy :P),
but I believe you're restricted by everyone elses's license.

The caching idea of the scripts was taken from here:
